# Independent Study Project

For this project, you will be assigned a specific algorithm or algorithms. For those algorithms, you will need to develop a brief overview document and code sample that describes how the algorithms work in language that is understandable by individuals new to coding. You will then submit your overview and present your algorithms to your peers.

You will be assigned one of the following algorithms or sets of algorithms:

#### Basic:

- Map
- Reduce
- Every
- Filter

#### Intermediate:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Mean, Median & Mode
- Parenthesis Matcher

#### Advanced:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Merge Sort
- Binary Search
- Fibonacci Sequence

## Project Scoring

This project has three different parts on which you will be graded. Each part is weighted differently.

- 40% of the project is scored on **completion**.
- 20% of the project is scored through the **mastery rubric**.
- 40% of the project is scored through the **presentation rubric**.

In total, you must receive at least 70% to complete this project. For example, you could attain 40% of points through the completion requirements, 20% of points through the **mastery rubric**, and 10% of points through the presentation rubric.

## Completion

To complete this assignment, you will need to complete the following tasks. Note that, for this project in particular, you are expected to use online resources to help you develop the code and explanation. This purpose of this project is to focus on understanding and communicating code.

### Set up

1. Create a Repo with an `index.js` file and a `readme.md` file.
1. Submit the link to the repo on Canvas

### index.js

2. Develop working JavaScript code for your algorithm(s). When the file is run, an example should be included to show that the function(s) work as intended.
1. Your code should be heavily commented with explanatory text, describing what is happening and why.

### readme.md

4. Your `readme.md` file should include an introduction to your algorithm(s), summarizing the purpose of the algorithm and an overview of how it works.
1. Your `readme.md` file should also include an "Algorithm description" section that details, step-by-step, how the algorithm works. You may wish to use images or code examples to get the point across.
1. Your `readme.md` file should also include a "Big O evaluation" section that examines the time complexity of the algorithm. It should state the correct complexity and describe why the algorithm has that complexity.
1. Your `readme.md` file should also include a "Use cases" section that describes when this algorithm may be used.
1. Your `readme.md` file should also include an "Edge cases and concerns" section that describes any constraints to using the algorithm or any situations where the algorithm will not yield the correct result.
1. Your `readme.md` file should also include a "Citations" section where you provide links to any websites, videos, or other resources you used to help generate your code or your explanation.
   1. Any ChatGPT citations should include a link to the conversation or conversations you had with chatGPT
1. Your `readme.md` file should be free from spelling errors and mistakes. Try to download the [vscode extension spell checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker), and/or copy the text to a google doc and use Grammarly to help you with the grammar
1. Your `readme.md` file should be understandable and clear.

## Mastery rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your increasing skill at writing good code and following best practices.

To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas.

## Presentation rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your ability to present your project and your code. These skills are crucial for succeeding in the course and getting your first job as a software developer. To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas. Take note that the presentation should take 5-8 minutes, including time for the instructors and the class to ask 1-3 questions.
